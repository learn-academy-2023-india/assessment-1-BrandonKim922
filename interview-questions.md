# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: Array's index is an order from starting 0 which tells how many things are in it. Its value is what each item in the array is.

Researched answer: 
An index in an array is a numeric representation used to identify the position of an element within the array.
The value in an array refers to the actual data stored at a specific index position within the array.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Both arrays and strings have index value. However, arrays can be changed while strings cannot.

Researched answer: Array is a collection of data, while string is sequences of characters. Array is mutable and string is immutable. Elements in array and characters in strings are both accessible via their index.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions: Higher-order Functions is a method of programming using built-in function that reduces much of its original progress.

2. Jest: Jest is a method of testing the work. However, I didn't quite understand how to actually use the method.

3. Objects: A subset of array that are specifically assigned. It is an information within an element.
